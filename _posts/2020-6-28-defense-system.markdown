- Designed a defense system for possible adversarial attack targeted at object detection algorithms, with generates noisy adversarial patches against YOLOv2 in human detection.

- Implemented a local gradient smoothing module with image enhancement, which enables YOLOv2 to defend against adversarial patches.
