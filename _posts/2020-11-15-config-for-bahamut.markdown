Completed at *Alibaba Group*, Hangzhou, China.  [Group](https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/whats-the-secret-behind-alibaba-s-artificial-intelligence-online-serving-ai-os-ebe7ed67f7d5)

This project is put into production in *SARO(Search, Advertisement, Recommendation Offline)* â€“ an offline big data Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) platform

SARO is an offline big data platform for search and recommendation, mainly used in [Taobao](https://world.taobao.com/) and [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/). 
Bahamut is the core processing engine of it, responsible for creating, scheduling, and computing data processing tasks.
We use Flink and Hbase as our computation and storage engine respectively.

Bahamut transforms business graph (input by user) to intermediate DAGs, and finally to Flink & Airflow jobs. 
During this procedure, configurations are needed to customize apps, environments and Flink options for job generation, resource allocation, devops, etc.

My job:
- Designed a Configuration-as-Code module to manage configuration and feature toggle for the core processing engine, which supports automatic release, update, and delivery of configuration files.
- Refactored code with user-friendly interface and well-organized configuration files. 
Provides sanity check and validation API with Java annotation.
