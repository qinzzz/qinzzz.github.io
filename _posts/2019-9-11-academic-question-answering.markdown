We construct PaperQA, a novel dataset focusing on the corpus of academic papers on machine learning. PaperQA consists of over 150,000 question-answer pairs posed by crowdworkers on a set of over 8,400 academic papers which are also linked into the corresponding heterogeneous information knowledge graph. 

We present an approach of answering academic questions by combining both semantic information and graph knowledge to enhance 
the prevalent pre-training model and successfully improve the language understanding on this task. We argue that leveraging position 
information of documents in the knowledge graph can enhance language representation in prevalent pre-training models and assist machine reading comprehension with external knowledge. 

The experimental results demonstrate that our model yield superior performance over state-of-the-arts on this task. 
Practically, our work has been deployed to help develop services on academic QA, which benefits researchers by saving them much time on retrieving relevant papers.
