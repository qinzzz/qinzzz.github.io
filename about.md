# Hello!

I am Qinxin Wang. I am currently a senior student majoring in [Information Security](https://infosec.sjtu.edu.cn/#) at [SEIEE](http://english.seiee.sjtu.edu.cn)
, [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn), graduating in 2021.
I was an exchange student at [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu) in 2020 spring, majoring in Computer Science.

Check out my [Résumé](assets/Qinxin_Wang_CV_v1_1.pdf).

## Experience

Since my sophomore year, I joined Acemap Knowledge Graph Group led by Prof. [Weinan Zhang](http://wnzhang.net) and Prof. [Xinbin Wang](http://iwct.sjtu.edu.cn/Personal/xwang8/index.html#). 
I worked on question answering for academic literature.

In 2020, I was a research assistant at UC Berkeley, supervised by Prof. [Michael Mahoney](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~mmahoney/).
My Research topic was weakly supervised phrase localization.

From Jun to Sep,2020, I was an intern at Alibaba Group, working with AI-OS team.
[Here](https://alibabatech.medium.com/the-achievement-of-a-computing-lifetime-alibaba-ai-os-10-years-on-442e5f25434a) is a brief introduction of this team.

I will complete my undergraduate thesis with Prof. [Shilin Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8tg3mv0AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) at School of Cyber Science and Engineering.
